## Day 1 — Microservice Basics & Cloud-Native Principles

**Slides cover:** Monolith vs. microservices · Bounded contexts · 12-Factor App ·
Cloud-native characteristics · Spring Boot runtime · Spring Boot Actuator ·
E-commerce running example

**Hands-on builds:** `inventory-service` — a fully working Spring Boot microservice
demonstrating 12-Factor config, Actuator health endpoints, graceful shutdown,
and service-to-service REST calls.

| Lab | What you do | Concept |
|-----|-------------|---------|
| Lab 1 | Run the service, explore `/actuator/*` | Actuator, health indicators |
| Lab 2 | Override config via env vars, change log level at runtime | 12-Factor III |
| Lab 3 | Observe graceful shutdown with in-flight requests | 12-Factor IX |
| Lab 4 | Drain stock, watch readiness flip DOWN | Custom health indicators |
| Lab 5 | Build `order-service`, call inventory via REST | Bounded contexts |

**Prerequisites:** Java 17+, Maven 3.8+, [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/)

---

## Day 2 — Distributed Computing Challenges

**Slides cover:** Fallacies of distributed computing · Failure modes ·
Timeout / Retry / Circuit Breaker · Bulkhead · Distributed data · Saga pattern ·
Idempotency · Observability (logs, metrics, tracing) · CAP theorem

**Hands-on builds:** Extended `order-service` with Resilience4j circuit breakers,
structured logging with traceId propagation, and idempotent order placement.
Requires `inventory-service` from Day 1.

| Lab | What you do | Concept |
|-----|-------------|---------|
| Lab 1 | Deliberately slow inventory-service, watch threads pile up | Cascading failure |
| Lab 2 | Add circuit breaker, watch it open and recover | Resilience4j |
| Lab 3 | Walk all three CB states via Actuator | CLOSED → OPEN → HALF-OPEN |
| Lab 4 | Correlate a request across two services by traceId | Structured logging |
| Lab 5 | Send duplicate orders with an idempotency key | Idempotency |

**Prerequisites:** Day 1 Lab 5 completed (both services running)

---

## Running the services

**Day 1 — inventory-service (port 8083):**
```bash
cd hands-on/day1/inventory-service
mvn spring-boot:run
```

**Day 2 — order-service (port 8082):**
```bash
cd hands-on/day2/order-service
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Quick health check:
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8083/actuator/health | jq ".status"
curl -s http://localhost:8082/actuator/health | jq ".status"
```
